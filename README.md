#Homework 2
This application was designed in order to challenge my abillities in developing a responsive webpage. 

While stuggling with how to make it responsive. I was not able to get very far in understanding the information due to lack of time however I was able to understand the concept behind making it responsive. We want to website or application to have the abbility to adjust its sizing automatically to fit the screen size available. 
I was able to acheive a small portion of this however I do not have it exactly to the level I would like. 

The futurre of this project is an unknown one at this time however I will continue to develop this in order provide an excellent profile for any viewers interested in my capabillities.
